# Customer Churn Prediction Project

Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and ensure sustainable growth. This project aims to develop a predictive model that anticipates customer churn in a subscription-based service or business.

## Overview

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's products or services. By identifying patterns indicative of potential churn, businesses can proactively take measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Features

- Data Collection: Obtain historical customer data, including demographic information and usage behavior.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.
- Model Development: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC AUC score, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- Additional Metrics: Calculate additional evaluation metrics such as specificity, balanced accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficient.
- Model Interpretability: Explore techniques for interpreting the model's predictions and identifying key predictive features.
- Visualization: Visualize model performance and key insights using plots and graphs.
